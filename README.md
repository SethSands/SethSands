Hello! On this site, my name is SethSands.
I'm here mainly to look for code that I may need and copy/replicate it with changes for my needs. Also whatever gamefiles for games I play that are here (case in point: Pokemon Unbound learnsets)
I'm an aspiring game developer, working on my first game by myself, so any help from here is greatly appreciated.
